			<h2><font color="##5B2C6F">RESEARCH INTERESTS</font></h2>
		</header>
		<p>Since I am still an early Master's student, I have a very broad range of interests but I do recognize a few areas where I think I can move forward. I am particularly interested towards the domains of Astronomy and Astrophysics, you can find a brief about few of my current my interests, but not limited to, in the following sections. I would love to expand my understanding in more interdiscilinary topics, if possible. </p>

					<h3>Numerical Hydrodynamical Simulations (MHD, rMHD, GRMHD)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Fluid Dynamics is present almost everywhere in the universe be it the solar plasma, accretion of proto-planetary, BHs, NSs,and what not. The application of numerical fluid dynamical simulations is not only limited to the astrophysical systems but also in the climate change studies and various industrial applications. <br /> This has been one of the most interesting topics to me, mostly due to the fact that I have worked Solar Spicules which was studied using the MHD simulations using the famous <b>PLUTO CODE</b> of the plasma prsent on the chromospheric layer of the sun, while also learning about the solar flares, coronal mass ejections, etc. I am actively learning computuaional fluid dynamics using a few pipelines like PENCIL CODE MHD besides already mentioned PLUTO CODE and via python. In accordance to this study, I would like to explore sun spots and it's associated magnetic field which is governed by the sun cycle.</p>

					<h3>General Theory of Relativity and the BNS, BBH mergers</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The Genreal Theory of Relativity is one of the most intriguing subject that I have had the opportunity to study. There are plenty of unanswered questions just lying here and there waiting tio be solved by someone. I would like to work in between the GR and the MHD simulations, this has a lot of potential from Kerr-Neumann black holes to Binary Black holes/Neutron Star mergers. <br /> An interesting extension of this study would be the involvement of the associated Graviational Waves (GWs) which is already being pursued by many of the researchers nowadyas. </p>

					<h3>Exoplanets: Super Earths, Mini Neptunes and Goldilocks Planets</h3>
				</header>
				<p>It is one my childhood dreams to explore the discoveries of planets similar to our Earth. Thanks to a few popular late night science shows, I got to know about the hot topic in the regime of Exoplanets, i.e., the super earths and mini neptunes. Besides having a brief literature knowledge over these topics, I don't really have anything concrete to contribute here.</p>
