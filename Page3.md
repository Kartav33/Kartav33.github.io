			<h2><font color="##5B2C6F">RESEARCH INTERESTS</font></h2>
		</header>
		<p>Since I am still an early Master's student, I have a very broad range of interests but I do recognize a few areas where I think I can move forward. I am particularly interested towards the domains of Astronomy and Astrophysics, you can find a brief about few of my current my interests, but not limited to, in the following sections. I would love to expand my understanding in more interdiscilinary topics, if possible. </p>

					<h3>Numerical Hydrodynamical Simulations (MHD, rMHD, GRMHD)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Association with dead stars, solar cycle, accretion disks, jets, This has been one of the most interesting topics to me, mostly due to the fact that I am working on Solar Spicules while also learning about the solar flares, coronal mass ejections, etc. I am also learning computuaional fluid dynamics using a few pipelines like PENCIL CODE and PLUTO CODE MHD. I would like to explore sun spots and it's associated magnetic field which is governed by the sun cycle.</p>

					<h3>BNS, BBH mergers and the associated GWs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>So far I have had the oppurtunities in reading and having a loose hands-on experience in the domain of Supernovae and Supernovae Remnants. I developed a few codes revolving around the stellar sturctures and the <i>lane-emden eqution</i>. While reading about the origin of cosmic rays, I got to know about a few important features related to supernovae remnants. I also got an oppurtuninty to work on two specific pulsars while cleaning there radio wave specturm using two different algorithms IQRM and RFClean. I would further like to explore the areas of binary star mergers and its associated study of gravitational waves. </p>

					<h3>Exoplanets: Super Earths and Mini Neptunes</h3>
				</header>
				<p>It is one my childhood dreams to explore the discoveries of planets similar to our Earth. Thanks to a few popular late night science shows, I got to know about the hot topic in the regime of Exoplanets, i.e., the super earths and mini neptunes. Besides having a brief literature knowledge over these topics, I don't really have anything concrete to contribute here.</p>
